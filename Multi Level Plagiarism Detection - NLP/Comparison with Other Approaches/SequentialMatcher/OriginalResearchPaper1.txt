The impact of health information technology on patient safety

Abstract
Since the publication of the original Institute of Medicine (IOM) report, there has been a rapid development and implementation of health information technology. However, there is limited scientific evidence available about the impact of health information technology on patient safety. This article aims to review the current scientific evidence on the effect of different health information technologies on improving patient safety outcomes. The findings suggest that health information technology can enhance patient safety by reducing medication errors, adverse drug reactions, and improving adherence to practice guidelines. The authors conclude that health information technology is a valuable tool for improving healthcare quality and safety. However, healthcare organizations must carefully consider which technologies to invest in since some have limited evidence of improving patient safety outcomes.

Introduction
The goal of healthcare is to provide safe care and avoid negative outcomes. Technology has been proposed as a means to reduce medical errors and improve patient safety. Health Information Technology (HIT) is defined as the use of computers and software to manage, store, and share healthcare information. HIT offers many opportunities for improving healthcare, including reducing errors, improving clinical outcomes, and tracking data over time. Since the publication of the Institute of  been an increase in the development and adoption of HIT. This review aims to summarize the scientific evidence on the impact of different HIT on improving patient safety outcomes. The review includes studies on interventions such as electronic medical records, clinical decision support, and bar code medication administration. The primary outcomes of interest were patient safety, medical errors, adverse events, and mortality. The review considered systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and randomized clinical trials. The Cochrane methodology was used to assess the studies for methodological validity and risk of bias. The results of this review can be used by clinicians and healthcare policy makers to make evidence-based decisions on the procurement and implementation of HIT to improve patient safety

Proposed Method
Numerous studies have investigated the impact of electronic medical records on healthcare quality and patient safety. While many studies have reported positive outcomes, some studies have shown negative results, leading to controversy. Campanella et al. conducted a large meta-analysis of 47 studies on the impact of electronic health records on healthcare quality and patient safety, which concluded that electronic medical records have a positive impact. The meta-analysis found that implementing electronic health records led to a 30% increase in guideline adherence, a 54% reduction in medication errors, and a 36% reduction in adverse drug reactions. However, the study did not find any impact on overall mortality. The use of computerized physician order entry and clinical decision support systems were found to be the most beneficial health information technologies for improving patient safety, while the impact of other technologies such as electronic sign-out and hand-off tools, smart pumps, and bar-code medication administration is inconclusive. Overall, electronic medical records have been shown to reduce medical errors and improve patient safety.
