    "og_literature_review": "There are many regularization methods in previous work. Label Smoothing [Szegedy et al., 2016] estimates the marginalized effect of label-dropout and reduces over-fitting by preventing a network from assigning full probability to each training example. Confidence Penalty [Pereyra et al., 2017] prevents peaked distributions, leading to better generalization. A network appears to be overconfident when it places all probability on a single class in the training set, which is often a symptom of overfitting. DropBlock [Ghiasi et al., 2018] is a structured form of dropout, it drops contiguous regions from a feature map of a layer instead of dropping out independent random units. Data augmentation methods are also used in practice to improve model’s accuracy and robustness when training neural networks."
