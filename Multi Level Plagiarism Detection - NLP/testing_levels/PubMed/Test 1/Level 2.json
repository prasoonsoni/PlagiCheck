    "og_ps_obj": "Since the publication of the original Institute of Medicine (IOM) report, there has been a rapid development and implementation of health information technology. However, there is limited scientific evidence available about the impact of health information technology on patient safety. This article aims to review the current scientific evidence on the effect of different health information technologies on improving patient safety outcomes. The findings suggest that health information technology can enhance patient safety by reducing medication errors, adverse drug reactions, and improving adherence to practice guidelines. The authors conclude that health information technology is a valuable tool for improving healthcare quality and safety. However, healthcare organizations must carefully consider which technologies to invest in since some have limited evidence of improving patient safety outcomes.",
    
    "og_introduction": "The goal of healthcare is to provide safe care and avoid negative outcomes. Technology has been proposed as a means to reduce medical errors and improve patient safety. Health Information Technology (HIT) is defined as the use of computers and software to manage, store, and share healthcare information. HIT offers many opportunities for improving healthcare, including reducing errors, improving clinical outcomes, and tracking data over time. Since the publication of the Institute of  been an increase in the development and adoption of HIT. This review aims to summarize the scientific evidence on the impact of different HIT on improving patient safety outcomes. The review includes studies on interventions such as electronic medical records, clinical decision support, and bar code medication administration. The primary outcomes of interest were patient safety, medical errors, adverse events, and mortality. The review considered systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and randomized clinical trials. The Cochrane methodology was used to assess the studies for methodological validity and risk of bias. The results of this review can be used by clinicians and healthcare policy makers to make evidence-based decisions on the procurement and implementation of HIT to improve patient safety.",

    "og_proposed_method": "Numerous studies have investigated the impact of electronic medical records on healthcare quality and patient safety. While many studies have reported positive outcomes, some studies have shown negative results, leading to controversy. Campanella et al. conducted a large meta-analysis of 47 studies on the impact of electronic health records on healthcare quality and patient safety, which concluded that electronic medical records have a positive impact. The meta-analysis found that implementing electronic health records led to a 30% increase in guideline adherence, a 54% reduction in medication errors, and a 36% reduction in adverse drug reactions. However, the study did not find any impact on overall mortality. The use of computerized physician order entry and clinical decision support systems were found to be the most beneficial health information technologies for improving patient safety, while the impact of other technologies such as electronic sign-out and hand-off tools, smart pumps, and bar-code medication administration is inconclusive. Overall, electronic medical records have been shown to reduce medical errors and improve patient safety."

This article is intended to review the current available scientific evidence on the impact of different health information technologies on improving patient safety outcomes. We conclude that health information technology improves patient’s safety by reducing medication errors, reducing adverse drug reactions, and improving compliance to practice guidelines. There should be no doubt that health information technology is an important tool for improving healthcare quality and safety. Healthcare organizations need to be selective in which technology to invest in, as literature shows that some technologies have limited evidence in improving patient safety outcomes.",


    "sus_introduction": "Patient safety is a subset of healthcare and is defined as the avoidance, prevention, and amelioration of adverse outcomes or injuries stemming from the processes of health care.1 In 1999 the Institute of Medicine’s (IOM) report “To err is human” called for developing and testing new technologies to reduce medical error,2 and the subsequent 2001 report “crossing the quality chiasm” called for using information technology as a key first step in transforming and changing the healthcare environment to achieve better and safer care.3 Healthcare information technology (HIT) has been defined as “the application of information processing involving both computer hardware and software that deals with the storage, retrieval, sharing, and use of health care information, data, and knowledge for communication and decision making”.4 Health information technology includes various technologies that span from simple charting, to more advanced decision support and integration with medical technology. Health information technology presents numerous opportunities for improving and transforming healthcare which includes; reducing human errors, improving clinical outcomes, facilitating care coordination, improving practice efficiencies, and tracking data over time. Since the original IOM report was published, there has been an accelerated development and adoption of health information technology with varying degrees of evidence about the impact of health information technology on patient safety. This review is intended to summarize the current available scientific evidence on the impact of different health information technologies on improving patient safety outcomes. This review might be useful for clinicians and healthcare policy makers when making evidence based decisions on procurement and implementation of such technology to improve patient safety. This review considered studies that were conducted in the healthcare settings both inpatient and community setting, with an intervention of any of the following; electronic physician’s orders (CPOE), clinical decision support (CDS), E-prescribing, electronic sign-out and hand-off tools, bar code medication administration (BCMA), smart pumps, automated medication dispensing cabinets (ADC), electronic medication administration record (eMAR), patient data management systems (PDMS), retained surgical items detectors, patient electronic portals, telemedicine, electronic incident reporting, and electronic medical record (EMR). Our primary outcomes of interest were patient safety, medical errors, adverse events, medication errors, adverse drug events, and mortality. The priority was given to systematic reviews, meta-analysis and randomized clinical trials. If such studies were not identified then other types of experimental studies or epidemiological study designs including; non-randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental, before and after studies, prospective and retrospective cohort studies and case control studies. Studies were excluded if they met any of the following criteria: high risk of bias, studies that were conducted in non-clinical settings, cointerventions with non-health information technology interventions, not evaluating patient safety outcomes, qualitative or narrative studies. The search strategy was conducted to find both published and unpublished studies. The search strategy included Medline, Embase, Cochrane Database. Studies published until January 2017 were considered for inclusion in this review. Initial keywords used were: Electronic Medical Record (EMR), Electronic Physician’s Order entry (CPOE), Clinical Decision Support (CDS), E-prescribing, Electronic Sign-out and Hand-off, Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA), Closed Loop Medication Administration, Patient Data Management Systems (PDMS), Retained Surgical Items Detectors, Patient Electronic Portals, Telemedicine, Electronic Incident Reporting, Intelligent Infusion Devices, Smart Pump, Programmable Pump, Automated Medication Dispensing, medication error adverse events, adverse drug events, adverse drug reactions, patient safety, medical errors. Studies were assessed for methodological validity and risk of bias using the Cochrane methodology prior to inclusion in the review.",

    "sus_proposed_method": "Numerous studies have considered the outcomes of implementing an electronic medical record on healthcare quality and patient safety, with a majority of studies showing favorable results. Although, some studies demonstrated negative outcomes which continues to evoke dispute. Campanella et al48 published perhaps the largest and most recent metaanalysis on the impact of electronic health records on healthcare quality and patient safety, which included 47 studies. The results favored the use of electronic medical records. The metaanalysis showed that organizations which implemented electronic health records had a 30% higher guideline adherence (RR= 1.33; 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.76; p=0.049), a reduction in medication errors by 54% (RR=0.46; 95% CI: 0.38 to 0.55; p<0.001) and a reduction in adverse drug reactions by 36% (RR=0.66; 95% CI: 0.44 to 0.99; p=0.045). The meta-analysis did not find any impact on overall mortality.DiscussionThere is substantial evidence that implementing an electronic medical record reduces medical errors and improves patient’s safety. Computerized physician order entry and CDS are probably one of the most beneficial health information technologies for improving patient safety. In addition, ADC systems and PDMS seem to improve patient safety in critical care setting. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion on patient safety outcomes for the following health information technologies; electronic sign-out and hand-off tools, smart pumps, bar-code medication administration, retained surgical items detectors, patient portals, telemedicine and electronic incident reporting. It is worth mentioning, that there is evidence that the aforementioned technologies seem to improve healthcare processes and non-safety outcomes Table 1 summarizes the evidence on various HIT technologies on patient safety."
