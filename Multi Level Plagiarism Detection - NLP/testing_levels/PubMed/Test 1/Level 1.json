    "og_literature_review": "There are many regularization methods in previous work. Label Smoothing [Szegedy et al., 2016] estimates the marginalized effect of label-dropout and reduces over-fitting by preventing a network from assigning full probability to each training example. Confidence Penalty [Pereyra et al., 2017] prevents peaked distributions, leading to better generalization. A network appears to be overconfident when it places all probability on a single class in the training set, which is often a symptom of overfitting. DropBlock [Ghiasi et al., 2018] is a structured form of dropout, it drops contiguous regions from a feature map of a layer instead of dropping out independent random units. Data augmentation methods are also used in practice to improve model’s accuracy and robustness when training neural networks."

    "sus_literature_review": "Previous research has used a variety of regularisation techniques. Label Smoothing [Szegedy et al., 2016] prevents a network from ascribing full probability to each training example, estimating the marginalised impact of label-dropout and lowering over-fitting. Peaked distributions are avoided by the confidence penalty (Pereyra et al., 2017), which improves generalisation. When a network assigns 100% of the likelihood to a single class in the training set, which is a common sign of overfitting, it appears to be overconfident. DropBlock [Ghiasi et al., 2018] is a structured version of dropout; rather than dropping out independent random units, it drops contiguous regions from a feature map of a layer. When training neural networks, data augmentation techniques are also applied to increase the model's accuracy and resilience."
